# strings-and-lists
**Overview**
This project consists of Java exercises that focus on manipulating strings and lists. The project is organized into two main parts:

_String Exercises_: Operations and manipulations related to string handling.
_List Exercises_: Tasks involving lists, including extensions of Java's built-in list structures.

**Project Structure**
The project contains the following directories:

_src/string/exercises_: Contains the StringExercises.java file, which includes a set of string manipulation tasks.
_src/list/exercises_: Contains two key files:
_ListExercises.java_: Exercises focused on list operations and manipulations.
_ExtendedArrayList.java_: A custom extension of Java's ArrayList with additional functionality.

**Prerequisites**
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

**How to Use**
Compile the Code: Navigate to the src directory in the terminal and use the following command to compile the Java files:

bash
Copy code
javac string/exercises/StringExercises.java list/exercises/*.java
Run the Exercises: Once compiled, you can run the exercises by executing the main method in the respective classes:

bash
Copy code
java string.exercises.StringExercises
java list.exercises.ListExercises
Each class contains various methods that implement different string and list manipulation tasks.

**File Descriptions**
_StringExercises.java_: Contains methods that demonstrate different string operations such as reversing a string, finding substrings, and more.
_ListExercises.jav_a: Implements list-related tasks, including searching, sorting, and manipulating lists.
_ExtendedArrayList.java_: An extension of the Java ArrayList class, adding additional list functionalities.
